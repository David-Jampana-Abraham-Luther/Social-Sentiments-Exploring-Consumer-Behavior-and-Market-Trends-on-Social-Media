# Social-Sentiments-Exploring-Consumer-Behavior-and-Market-Trends-on-Social-Media
Sentiment analysis on social media data using PySpark and NLP techniques to explore consumer behavior and emerging market trends across industries. Built and run on Databricks.

**📌 Project Overview**
This project develops a sentiment analysis model for social media data to understand consumer behavior and emerging market trends across industries and demographics. With millions of users expressing opinions on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, this project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to uncover actionable insights for businesses.

🎯 Project Goals
Collect and preprocess real-time social media data.

Use NLP and machine learning to classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).

Identify market trends and consumer preferences across industries and user groups.

Support data-driven decisions for marketing, product development, and brand management.

🧠 Motivation
Social media shapes purchasing decisions, brand perception, and consumer engagement. This project aims to provide businesses with a scalable solution to:

Analyze public sentiment toward products or services.

Stay ahead of consumer trends.

Optimize campaigns and engagement strategies.
